4. What is the best way to do performance testing?
The best way to conduct performance testing depends on your specific requirements and the nature of your application. Some highly recommended best practices include:
 

1.Identifying performance goals early in the development process.
2.Creating realistic test scenarios to simulate real-world user behavior.
 Using a mix of tools and approaches, including load testing, stress testing, and scalability testing, to cover different aspects of performance.
3.Conducting testing in a controlled environment that resembles the production  environment as closely as possible.
4.Monitoring results to identify bottlenecks, performance issues, and areas for  improvement.
5.Iteratively optimizing and retesting the application to achieve the desired performance levels.
	
Bottlenecks:
------------
Bottlenecks are obstructions in the system that decrease the overall performance of an application. They are usually caused by hardware problems or lousy code.
